1. The file UM.c realizes user manager.
2. The file shsh.c realizes the shsh shell.
3. The file user.c realizes the user.
4. The file admin.c realizes the admin.
5. Assume: When the shsh shell command "cmd" with one command, 
    we test whether the command needs input. Because of more 
    than one command, we can't distinguish which command needs 
    input.
6. Assume: Correct user behaviors. Each user (same userid) 
   will not make multiple logins before logging out. The 
   commands issued by the users are correct and conforming 
   to the required format. No commands with non-explicit 
   interactions (e.g., text editors) will be issued.
